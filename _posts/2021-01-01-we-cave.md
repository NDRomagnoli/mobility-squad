# Description
Safely guiding pedestrians through traffic by clearly communicating the intentions of an automated vehicle.

The driver of a manually driven car currently communicates their intentions and situational awareness through for example eyesight and gestures. However, in an automated vehicle the driver becomes a passenger. This means that the communication between the driver and other road users is lost. This can be especially dangerous for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. This communication gap needs to be filled. The we-CAVE project aims to help do this through an interface on the exterior of the car that can communicate the car’s situational awareness and intentions to other road users.
