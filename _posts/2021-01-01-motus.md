# Description
A memory palace in your environment that can act as your personal assistant.

Motus is a memory palace in your environment that can act as your personal assistant in an autonomous car. Create your own content like reminders, notes, doodles and save them at specific locations along your journey. Keep your focus on the road while sharing your thoughts and experiences with the world.

A project by: Louise de Laat, Steven Rollis, Jim van de Ven, Niels Winkelman
