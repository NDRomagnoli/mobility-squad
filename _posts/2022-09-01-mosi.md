short: Exploring external signals from automatedly driven vehicles for vulnerable road users. 
---

## Description
The technology of automatedly driven vehicles is approaching ever faster, and with this comes the challenge of developing ways to allow them to mix with traffic as we know it today. To aid this transition for vulnerable road users specifically, we designed signals for three specific situations; braking, accelerating, and turning. The stripes on each signal increase the harder a car breaks, the faster it accelerates, or the closer it is to its turn. These coloured shapes will be displayed on the car with the technology of e-ink.
