short: Concept for sharing of awareness between human and car.

# Description
For anything in between a fully automated car and a manual car, sharing of awareness between human and car is necessary. However, a user of an automated car could be willing to take advantage of the autonomy of the car and perform an alternative activity. By providing proximal peripheral light signals, the traffic situations is communicated to the user of the car. In this way, one can perform a alternative task and still be aware of the surroundings.

This concept was validated through research in the field. The participants of the project were asked to perform an alternative task in a car on the real road and answered questions about the situation in real-time.
