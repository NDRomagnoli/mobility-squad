## Description
How to create privacy in a shared ride?

Traveling will become more convenient following the implementation of shared automated vehicles. However, with traveled vehicle kilometers predicted to rise, there is a necessity for increasing the vehicle occupancy by ridesharing.

To increase the vehicle occupancy, research needs to be done on how the user expectations of ridesharing can be increased especially since critical mass will be a KPI for Shared Automated Vehicles. My goal is to get people in shared automated vehicles by increasing user expectations.

My prototype can create a private cabin in a shared vehicle. The demonstrator is the result of several experiments in which key hypotheses were tested. The demonstrator will be used in a survey to validate whether the prototype will increase user expectations.
