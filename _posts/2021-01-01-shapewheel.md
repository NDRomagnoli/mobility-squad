# Description
Shapewheel: physically facilitating the transition of control in level 3 automated vehicles.

ShapeWheel is a device that helps facilitating level 3 automated cars in asking the driver to regain control. It does so by notifying the driver in advance using a shape changing interface. When it is time to take over, the steering wheel physically approaches the driver by emerging from the dashboard.
